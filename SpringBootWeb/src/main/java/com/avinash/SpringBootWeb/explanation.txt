look lets have a look at MVC in java
MVC stands for Model - View - Control

Model
Model is responsible to fetch data from database
Model is responsible also for updating data in the database
it gives the data to the Controller
Model means a POJO

View Technology
View is a presentation layer
It concerns about how to display the data to the client
View receive the request from the client and give the request to the controller
after model returning the data to the controller, the view will give that data to the client
there are many view technologies available like JSP(Java Server Pages) , thymeleaf etc

Controller
Controller is responsible for accepting requests from clients
The data processing will be happened in the Controller
Controller is between view technology and Model
Controller means Servlet

in springboot we can create a Controller using Annotation @Controller
in SpringBoot we can do multiple URL mappings in a single Controller
the communication between view Technology and Controllers is done by three objects
1. HttpSession 2. Model 3. ModalAndView

1. HttpSession
HttpSession is session scope
that means we can exchange data between multiple request in a controller
it is long span. that means the data is available until the session is validate
We can use session for dealing the user login details

2.Model
Model Object is request Scope
that means data is available is only available for one request cycle(until the client receives the data from server for a sent request)
hence It is short span
in this we will return the view technology name as string

3. ModelAndView
ModelAndView is also request Scope
It is short span
we can return the object and view file together
it provides more flexibility compared to the Model
